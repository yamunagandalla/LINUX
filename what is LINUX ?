# What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system — just like Windows and macOS.  
But the special thing is: Linux is free, open-source, powerful, and used everywhere in cybersecurity.  
Think of it as the favorite OS of hackers, security professionals, programmers, and servers.

## Why is Linux so famous?

⭐ **1. It’s Free & Open Source**  
Anyone can download, use, modify, or improve it.  
That's why hackers love it — you fully control the system.

⭐ **2. It’s Super Secure**  
Linux is built with strong permissions and strict security.  
That’s why:
- 90% of servers run on Linux
- All cybersecurity tools work best on Linux
- Most hacking labs use Linux machines like Kali, Parrot OS, Ubuntu

⭐ **3. It’s Fast and Lightweight**  
It runs smoothly even on old laptops.

⭐ **4. It Uses Terminal**  
This gives you full power.  
You can control everything using commands — which is super important in cybersecurity.

⭐ **5. Most Tools Run Only on Linux**  
Important cybersecurity tools like:
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- Wireshark
- Hydra
- John the Ripper
- Aircrack-ng
- Nikto
- Gobuster  

…all work best on Linux.

## Where is Linux used?

Everywhere you depend on daily:
- Android phones → based on Linux
- Servers → run Linux
- Supercomputers → almost all run Linux
- Hacking labs → Linux
- Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) → Linux servers
- Routers → use Linux internally

Linux is literally the backbone of the internet.
